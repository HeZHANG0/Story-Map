# Story-Map: A tour through parks in San Francisco
Midterm project for MUSA 611

The story map consists of 5 slides:
First, let's have a look at all park spaces in San Francisco.
Then, let's zoom in to different kinds of parks. I will also show the total number of this kind of park we are looking at, and include an example when we zoom in. For the examples, I took the photos.

Thanks!
